What are coordinates?   
Generally speaking, coordinates are a way to describe locations using numbers.    In Minecraft, we might see where our character is, create a block in a particular location, or describe where a player or mob is located.

How do Minecraft coordinates work?

With the coordinates showing, practice moving your character so that only one number changes.  Move forward / backward, left / right, and up/down.   Watch the numbers get larger and smaller.

Each of these three numbers is assigned a letter.   All three of these numbers used together as a group describe a location in the game world.

The first number shows how far from left to right (east or west) a location is.   This part of the coordinate is referred to by the letter “X”.  We would call this the “X coordinate.”   The X coordinate increases as you move toward the east.

The number in the middle represents how high or low a location is.  This number is referred to as the “Y coordinate.”    The Y coordinate increases as you get higher.

The number to the right represents how far forward or backward (north or south) a location is.  This number is referred to as the “Z coordinate.”   The Z coordinate increases as you move toward the south.
Origin
The very center of the world is called the “origin”.   This is the point at which the X, Y, and Z coordinates are all zero.   Typically, the Y value of zero is far below your character’s feet, but you could always tunnel down to check things out there if you wish.
