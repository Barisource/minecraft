Minecraft Scripts and Utilities

This repository (a collection of online computer documents) contains many programs (special computer documents filled with instructions that the computer understands.)   Many of these documents contain instructions that tell Minecraft how to place blocks nearly automatically.   

Every time a block is put somewhere automatically, Minecraft needs to know things like what time of block and where to place it.   Telling Minecraft what type of block is easy, since every type of block has a name.  The slightly harder part is telling Minecraft *where* to put the block.   This is done using numbers that are called "Coordinates".

<h2>What are coordinates?</h2>   
Generally speaking, coordinates are a way to describe locations using numbers.    In Minecraft, we might see where our character is, create a block in a particular location, or describe where a player or mob is located.

<h2>How do Minecraft coordinates work?</h2>

With the coordinates showing, practice moving your character so that only one number changes.  Move forward / backward, left / right, and up/down.   Watch the numbers get larger and smaller.

Each of these three numbers is assigned a letter.   All three of these numbers used together as a group describe a location in the game world.

The first number shows how far from left to right (east or west) a location is.   This part of the coordinate is referred to by the letter “X”.  We would call this the “X coordinate.”   The X coordinate increases as you move toward the east.

The number in the middle represents how high or low a location is.  This number is referred to as the “Y coordinate.”    The Y coordinate increases as you get higher.

The number to the right represents how far forward or backward (north or south) a location is.  This number is referred to as the “Z coordinate.”   The Z coordinate increases as you move toward the south.

<h2>Origin</h2>  

The very center of the world is called the “origin”.   This is the point at which the X, Y, and Z coordinates are all zero.   Typically, the Y value of zero is far below your character’s feet, but you could always tunnel down to check things out there if you wish.
